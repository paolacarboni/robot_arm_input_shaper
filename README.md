Reducing undesired vibrations is a fundamental aspect for effective control of robot manipulators.

The project consists in the implementation of the Input
Shaping Technique for vibration reduction proposed by Singer and Seering.

A one-link flexible arm is considered for linear and non-linear vibration effects.
